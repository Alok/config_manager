# config_manager

This is TJ's configuration repo. Feel free to use whatever you would like from it! It'd be great if you mentioned where it came from if you think it's cool.

Major areas include:

## Neovim / Vim

Check the `nvim` folder for configuration. The Vim folder is very out of date.

## Shell

I don't really use bash anymore. I'm using zsh these days. Check that folder for configuration
