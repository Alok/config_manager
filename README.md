# config_manager

This will try and keep track of all of my `important` files across multiple machines.
By `important` I mostly mean configuration files, but also files to install the other `important` types of files.

The general idea is that if I come to a new system (or had to remake an old system :) ), all I would have to do is pull down this repository and I would enter into a familiar work environment, with the tools and resources that I use on a semi-frequent to frequent basis. 

It will also allow me to try and document changes that I make so I'm able to remember why I made certain changes when I did.

## BASH

I don't really use bash anymore. I'm using zsh these days.

## Docs

These are personal documents that I use to keep track of across multiple machines.

Many of them I like to have version controlled so that I can see what the changes are over time, as well as go back to resources that I thought I potentially did not need anymore

It also contains some `gimli` files that I use across machines. I hope to update this with more `.css` files in the future so I'm able to make markdown even prettier while using `gimli`. I have not found a different alternative for markdown, and I'm not sure that I really need to either I suppose.

## Python

The python folder consists of multiple sections:

- installs
    - This is a simple section. It simply contains scripts to install python modules that I use a lot or that are required in my tools section.
    - I hope to create some scripts to manage this better in the future, but it's more of an "on-the-fly" type deal
- school_tools
    - This section contains tools I use for school projects.
    - For example, a script to split up a pdf into multiple images, and then include those images into a markdown document for note taking.

## Task

Task warrior optimizations. This requires a lot more work currently

## VIM

Oh VIM, how I love thee. Have a folder for configuration files and an install script!
