# Things to do

## VIM

- How to unmap a key for one stroke? Or temporarily unmap?
    - This is mostly do to the instance where we are typing the `bar` key in my markdown documents and it will always try and do the table format, which is really not what I want to do, particularly if I'm going to be typing any type of coding (particularly in bash).
    - One solution would simply be to map another key to the bar key (and insure that the bar key is not set to recursively map things)
