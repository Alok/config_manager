# Things to Read

This file contains things that I consider useful to read. It often contains ideas about large and general things I want to learn more about

## VIM
- http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_32.html
    - This document is about undo and redo
    - It can send you back in time, send you back to last file save, forward to next file save
    - Examples
        - `:undolist`     See what branches we have in the undo tree
        - `:earlier 10m`  Sends us back in time 10 minutes to what the file looked like then
